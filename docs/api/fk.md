## fk(toModelNameOrObj, [relatedName]) â‡’ <code>ForeignKey</code>
Defines a foreign key on a model, which points
to a single entity on another model.

You can pass arguments as either a single object,
or two arguments.

If you pass two arguments, the first one is the name
of the Model the foreign key is pointing to, and
the second one is an optional related name, which will
be used to access the Model the foreign key
is being defined from, from the target Model.

If the related name is not passed, it will be set as
`${toModelName}Set`.

If you pass an object to `fk`, it has to be in the form

```javascript
fields = {
  author: fk({ to: 'Author', relatedName: 'books' })
}
```

Which is equal to

```javascript
fields = {
  author: fk('Author', 'books'),
}
```
