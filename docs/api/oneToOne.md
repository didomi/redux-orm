## oneToOne(toModelNameOrObj, [relatedName]) â‡’ <code>OneToOne</code>
Defines a one-to-one relationship. In database terms, this is a foreign key with the
added restriction that only one entity can point to single target entity.

The arguments are the same as with `fk`. If `relatedName` is not supplied,
the source model name in lowercase will be used. Note that with the one-to-one
relationship, the `relatedName` should be in singular, not plural.

**Kind**: global function
